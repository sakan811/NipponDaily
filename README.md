**What**: A Japan news web application that provides web-based access to Japan-related news articles with AI-powered categorization and intelligent summaries. The app searches the web for recent news mentioning Japan and processes it through AI for better organization and readability.

**Why**: Traditional news consumption can be overwhelming with endless scrolling and irrelevant content. NipponDaily solves this by using AI to intelligently organize news into clear categories and generate summaries, helping users quickly find and understand the stories that matter most to them across Politics, Business, Technology, Culture, and Sports.

**How**: The app fetches news using the Tavily API with basic search depth, categorizes articles with Google Gemini AI, and presents them in a clean, responsive interface. Users can load news on-demand, filter by category and time range, read AI-generated summaries for quick understanding, and click through to original articles when they want more detail.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Add API keys to `.env`:

   ```bash
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Start development server**:

   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage
